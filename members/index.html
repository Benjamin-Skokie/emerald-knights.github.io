                engineering, and joined the team after being recommended by our Coach Ms. Z. Ironically, Amanda is bad
                at using technology and is even more gullible, falling for every prank the team does to her. When Amanda
                drives the robot, the robot spends more time crashing into the wall than scoring points. In her free time,
                Amanda likes to sew and do crafts.

            Perry was a cadder and builder on EK during the 2020-21 season. He chose to join because of EK's flexible schedule,
            and used cad to create rough prototypes of the robot. After the CAD is done, he usually helps build as a portable slave.
            Unfortunately, Perry had to move to England, where he now is apart of FTC Team 1884 and 1797,
            the Griffins and Phoenix. In his free time, Perry swims, does Cross Country, and plays Destiny 2.
