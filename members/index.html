                he eventually was able to integrate well into the EK team, putting in the time to make his mark on the team.
                In his free time, Ryan likes bottom fragging in Valorant, vlogging, and egirls.

            Katrina served in outreach from 2017-18. She was always willing to volunteer to mentor many different FLL teams and go to different outreaches,
            like one in Warren NJ, where she had a personality perfect for working with children. Her optimism and presence
            made her a strong morale boost for the team, where she could easily bring up the mood of the team.
            Katrina also participated in Track, where she was a hurdler.

            Ben was a coder for EK from 2016-2018. As head of code in ‘17-18, he taught most of the team the basics of
            coding in robotics using things like motors, sensors, and servos. His code served as the earliest template
            in many seasons, and is still used to teach freshman now. His dedication to the robot meant he would often
            stay up late in a hotel room at worlds, running the autonomous one more time to make sure it worked well.
